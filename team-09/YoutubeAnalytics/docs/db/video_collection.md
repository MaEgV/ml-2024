        "title": "Your body language may shape who you are | Amy Cuddy",
        "description": "Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see ourselves. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy argues that \"power posing\" -- standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don't feel confident -- can boost feelings of confidence, and might have an impact on our chances for success. (Note: Some of the findings presented in this talk have been referenced in an ongoing debate among social scientists about robustness and reproducibility.
